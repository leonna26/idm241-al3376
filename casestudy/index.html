        <p>
            This case study outlines a project completed for IDM 241: Microinteractions. The project was broken into three parts - a simple, medium, and complex microinteraction. I chose to develop a microinteraction for a search feature in order to create a more
            engaging, interactive experience. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used in the making of this project. Through personal research looking into resources, guidance from professor, classmates, and friends, I was able to strengthen my knowledge
            and proficiency of these languages in order to achieve the goals and plans I had intended.

        <p>
            Background:
            <br> This project was produced as an individual project for a class - specifically IDM 241; Microinteractions. The class teaches students to build upon HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create a microinteraction(s).
            <br>
            <br> Description:
            <br> What classifies as a microinteraction? A microinteraction includes four-five elements: a trigger(s), rule(s), feedback, and loops/modes. For my project, I decided to create a microinteraction that would animate a search feature based
            on inspiration I found from Dribble.com. Upon clicking the search icon, the icon will lower itself and then open horizontally into a search bar with a text input field. After that, the user will be able to click the icon again to return the
            icon to its original position. This is a microinteraction that I hope to sometime implement and put into a website of my own. The project as a whole was split into three parts: simple, medium, and complex microinteraction.
            <br>
            <br> Timeline:
            <br> The timeline for the whole duration of this project was the course of ten weeks. There were various stages of the process - including an alpha, beta, and final. These all culminated into the whole project.
            <br>
            <br> Purpose:
            <br> The purpose of this project was to enhance an element of an interaction, specifically the search function, of a website. This project also hoped to build upon and expand pre-existing knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            <br>
            <br> The Problem:
            <br> So far, my personal website does not have a search function. My project for IDM232 uses a search function, but it is currently not interactive. Creating a microinteraction like this would give me something to implement in my websites
            that is engaging and interactive to my users instead of just remaining static.
            <br>
            <br> Goals & Objectives:
            <br> The goals of this project were to create a fully functioning interactive search feature. The objectives include: users being able to click the search icon, the search text field opening horizontally, and the icon being able to close and
            return to its original position.

        <h2 id="process"> Process and Insights </h2>

        <p>
            For the design process, I drew inspiration from Dribble. Here is the source to the reference that I wanted to build:
            <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6740993-Search-Animation" target="_blank">Source example</a>
            <br> The process of this project was divided up into three parts: simple, medium, and complex microinteraction to create the final result.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> 1. Simple Microinteraction: for this microinteraction, the goal was for the user to be able to click the search icon and have the icon bounce down once clicked. This project forced me to have a refresher on JavaScript. I tried to research
            and look up alternative ways to implement an onclick function without having to use JavaScript, but finally gave in. It was a good review to need to use it. One of the biggest problems that I encountered when making this simple microinteraction
            was how to get the animation to bounce down properly. There was always something wrong with the trigger where the trigger click would only work once the page is refreshed, and it would not have the bouncy animation effect I desired. fiAfter
            researching and trying to find ways to troubleshoot, I tried switching the animation name from "bounceInDown" to "bounceOutDown" and this helped the animation out a lot. At first, the animation swooped down but in doing so it was too fast
            and sort of disappeared/faed in the process. In the end, the bounceOutDown function somehow worked and produced a smooth drop to the icon animation. Here is the GIF for the Simple Microinteraction Build reference.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br> 2. Medium Microinteraction: for this microinteraction, users can hover over the search icon and a search bar with a text input field opens horizontally. For this project, I looked for reference code in CodePen.io to find similar examples
            of a search bar expanding. I added hover states to classes so that it triggered what I wanted the element to do when a user hovered over it. The two frustrations I had for this part of the project was trying to figure out to get the "Search"
            text to display over the search bar instead of below it. I could not figure it out for the longest time! Finally, I tried margin-top with a negative number instead of positive. And it finally worked! Another huge frustration was trying to
            get the search icon to stay within the search bar once it was expanded. When the screen or browser width was resized to be smaller, the search icon would clip down off of the search bar content. With the help of several media queries for the
            search bar, I was able to adjust the width of the search bar. This solved the problem of having content be too wide and therefore not being contained in the search bar. Looking back, I feel like this microinteraction in itself was not hard
            to put together. Instead, all the power held within the mind - of trying to troubleshoot, knowing what to search for to utilize sample code, and executing/manipulating the reference code into something that is what I desire. Here is the GIF
            that visualizes this concept for the Medium Microinteraction Build.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br> 3. Complex Microinteraction: for this microinteraction, the goal is for users to be able to click the search icon to drop down, then open horizontally to enter text into a text field. Users should then be able to click again to bring
            the icon back to the original stage. Final build reference GIF which consists of all of the animations put together:
            <img src="../graphics/fullanimation.gif" alt="Microinteraction Gif" class="center">
            <br> The GIF that is shown above is what I was hoping to accomplish in this stage of the process. However, I got stuck trying to figure out how to combine the two elements of the bounce down and search bar using JavaScript. After troubleshooting,
            researching on the web, and playing around, I figured out that I had to use an event listener that detects when my first animation ends, to trigger the second animation to begin. I utilized add and remove to alter the object when the first
            animation was done. From this complex animation, I learned that I didn't know as much JavaScript as I thought - or sometimes (a lot of times) the plan I have in my head exceeds my knowledge or abilities, and then I get discouraged having to
            research or ask for help. I've always tried to run away from JavaScript, but this project taught me if I have an idea in mind, I have to patiently take the necessary means and resources to get there. If I had used my time and resources better,
            I would have added functionality to close the search bar and return it to the original position. Overall, I am incredibly relieved that I was even able to reach this point in the project.

        <p>
            Overall, I am pleased with how this came out. I was able to implement the elements I had planned prior to the build process for each part of the project. I was able to cement my knowledge of JavaScript, as well as explore different CSS animation functions.
            I was also able to grow better at using media queries, since I had several problems getting my site responsive enough or format correctly at all times. Comparing my alpha and beta builds, the search icon is differnt between the two. In the
            future, I would have stuck with the same one or adjusted the other accordingly. I would also adjust the opacity or "drop" of the animation in the alpha build. Although it is fully functioning, if I were to refine it more, I would not have
            the slight hiccip of the search icon bouncing up for a fraction of a second before dropping down. I also notice that in the reference GIF there is not so much variation to the search icon itself when it is bouncing down. It appears that there
            is some opacity difference as the search icon comes down, however that is not the case in the beta build. Therefore with those things said, I would try to get the icon as smooth and seemless as possible, refining the animation and the opacity
            of the element. Like I mentioned in the complex animation description, although I was not able to achieve everything I had set to do, this project as a whole has pushed me in many ways to utilize the resources and tools that are easily accessible
            - like professors, classmates, and things on the web.
